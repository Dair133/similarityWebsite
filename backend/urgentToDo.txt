re query if paper has no abstract - DONE
test wider range of papers
make sure that shared authors, citaitons and references are  being calculated and correctly passed to model , may make a large difference in results - DONE
immediatly implement testing scripts , both determinsitic ones and google scholar testing script.
possibly re run the mdeol a few times to get papers with least number of random results????
implement some form of basic cache to ensure that haiku returns the same thing every time AND at same time consider moving to gemini flash or some other superior cheap model
remove seemingly ranom sving of papers as jons and other file tpoyes
its possible that seed paper entered has semantic scholar data but DOES NOT have an abstract, this sohuld be treated as having NO semantic scholar data
Haiku should be given first 3 pages an potentially last 3 pages to make sure that if paper does not have semtantic scholar that it can get the references citaitons etc,

maybe I can get Haiku to extract authors from papers that are NOT in semantic scholar, then I can
search semantic scholar for the author , maybe it will return author name in stadardised format.

If this does not work , important that we implement some type of rules function which is able to tell if 
papers have identical authors even if they are not identical
