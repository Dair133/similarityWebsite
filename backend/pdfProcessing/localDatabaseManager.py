#         # Ok we need a funciton which simply returns the papers from the poison_pill_papers_With_SciBert.xlsx in the correct data structure
        
        
#         # TO BE IMPLEMENTED
#         # Dont do this yet but we are gonna need some form of pre sampling, so we DONT have to compare the seed paper to every paper int he local db
#         # Im thinking we compare seed paper to 5 papers from every main topic, get average similarity per main topic
#         # THen compare seed paper with only papers from main topic that have highest similarity
